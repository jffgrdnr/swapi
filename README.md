Star Wars API

--------------------------

This demo app was built as part of a coding challenge with the Star Wars API (https://swapi.co/)


These are some of the features that are currently working:

1. /characters returns the first 10 characters in the API
2. /character?sort=[query] will sort those characters by the query parameter ( options are name, mass, height )
3. /character/:name will return the specified character by name (for example: /character/luke  /character/leia )
